# Introduction

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Echo = False means to not show the code chunk in the report, but the code will run.
project <- "HDCA heart"
```

This is the initial single cell RNA-seq analysis for the `r project` project.

The analysis is compiled in the format of a "book", using the package `bookdown`.
You can see the chapters and the subheadings in the index to the left.

Some chapters are short, while others are a bit longer. Also, some chapters contain more comments than others.


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Set output parent directory
myfolder <- "/Users/juliafoyer/ST/HDCA_heart/single_cell/results/"
```

```{r, echo=F, eval=F}
# How to paste images if I only care about seeing them from my computer.
# Put the following line outside of an r chunk.
# ![](`r paste0(myfolder, "images/03-QC_umap_unfiltered.png")`)
```
