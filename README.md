# HDCA_heart_dev

This repository contains the scripts used for the analysis of the single-cell RNA seq data of the embryonic heart developmental atlas (HDCA). 
Since several environments have been used along the project, below you will find a chart presenting the pipeline used with the corresponding scripts.

## Pipeline
All the scripts are found in the [script folder](./code).

## Environments
The information regarding the environments used for the study are found in the [environments folder](./environments).

## Data
The preprocessed data and the intermediate .Rds object are found on <NEED TO DECIDE WHERE>.
Metadata as annotation files or stereoscope output are in the [metadata folder](./metadata).

## Resources
The analyses presented in this repository were predominantly conducted on a MacBook Pro M2 Max chip, 32 GB of memory, running Ventura 13.0; however, some computations were also executed on a private server for enhanced performance and scalability.
